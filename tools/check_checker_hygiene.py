"""Assert the checker contract against the checkers themselves.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-08)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The AitherOS coding discipline (``.claude/rules/tech-debt-ledger.md``) says a
mechanically-detectable defect must become a CHECK, not a ledger row, and that
every check must:

  1. have a ``--self-test`` that proves it can still fail,
  2. be wired somewhere unattended (CI or a routine),
  3. exit non-zero (2), never 0, when it cannot run,
  4. name a debt id in any allowlist entry, printed on every run.

Nothing asserted that the checkers obey their own contract. Docs drifted from
reality (``tech-debt-ledger.md`` said "22 checkers"; the gate tree holds ~140).
This check is the process codified: it reads the rules, the CI workflow and the
routine gate list and asserts the contract against the tools they name.

Invariants
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  HYG001 (gate)   every checker that is DOCUMENTED (named in the quality-gate
                  rules) or WIRED (named in the debt-invariants workflow or the
                  debt-gate-probe routine) declares a ``--self-test``. A gate
                  that cannot prove it can fail is not a gate.
  HYG002 (gate)   every checker path named in the quality-gate rules exists on
                  disk. A documented gate that is not a file is a broken ref.
  HYG003 (gate)   every checker wired in CI or a routine exists on disk. A
                  wired gate that is not a file runs nothing.
  HYG004 (report) the backlog a gate must never open with: wired-but-
                  undocumented checkers (an invisible gate nobody can
                  question), total ``check_*.py``, how many lack ``--self-test``
                  tree-wide, and how many are wired nowhere. Printed by
                  ``--all``; never a gate. A check that floods gets switched
                  off, which is how this repo's per-file-ignores came to exist.
  HYG005 (gate)   the discipline's duplicated artifacts stay IDENTICAL across
                  their delivery homes — the portable twin in aither-skills,
                  the bundled aither-adk pack, and the published pack template.
                  A drift between copies is the "duplicated source of truth"
                  hazard code-like-david rule 11 calls active: editing one
                  copy silently orphans the others. Skipped for a layout that
                  does not carry a given home.

A probe that cannot read its sources exits 2, never 0 — silence is not a pass.
Use ``--self-test`` to prove it can still fail (it points the reference set at
a nonexistent file and asserts the gate goes red).

Portable twin lives at ``aither-skills/tools/check_checker_hygiene.py`` — same
logic, layout-detected root (AitherOS monorepo, generic ``dev/tools`` install,
or bare ``tools/``), so an external repo that adopted the discipline can run it.

    narrow one: this is a FILE-LEVEL heuristic. It asks whether the file contains
    a comment-skipping idiom at all, so a tool that parses the marker correctly in
    one place and carelessly in another passes. It reliably catches the real shape
    — a tool that never handles comments anywhere, which is how BOTH live
    instances looked — and deliberately does not attempt dataflow it cannot do
    accurately.

    BOTH correct idioms are accepted — `startswith("#")` skipping and
    `split("#", 1)[0]`. An earlier version of this detector knew only the first
    and produced a FALSE POSITIVE on check_baked_code_staleness.py, which was
    correct all along; a rule that cries wolf gets switched off.
